## Exceptions with third-party libraries
The third-party libraries have their own way of addressing authorship and the authorship of commits importing/updating
a third-party library reflects who did the importing instead of who wrote the code within the commit.

The authors of third-party libraries are not explicitly mentioned, and usually is possible to obtain from the files belonging to the third-party libraries.
