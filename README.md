## Setup

If you are only looking to install Erupe, please use [a pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/ZeruLight/Erupe/releases/latest).

If you want to modify or compile Erupe yourself, please read on.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

1. Bring up a fresh database by using the [backup file attached with the latest release](https://github.com/ZeruLight/Erupe/releases/latest/download/SCHEMA.sql).
2. Run each script under [patch-schema](./patch-schema) as they introduce newer schema.
3. Edit [config.json](./config.json) such that the database password matches your PostgreSQL setup.
4. Run `go build` or `go run .` to compile Erupe.

## Docker

Please see [docker/README.md](./docker/README.md). This is intended for quick installs and development, not for production. 

## Schemas 

We source control the following schemas: 
- Initialization Schema: This initializes the application database to a specific version (9.1.0).
- Update Schemas: These are update files that should be ran on top of the initialization schema.
- Patch Schemas: These are for development and should be run after running all initialization and update schema. These get condensed into `Update Schemas` and deleted when updated to a new release.
- Bundled Schemas: These are demo reference files to give servers standard set-ups. 

Note: Patch schemas are subject to change! You should only be using them if you are following along with development.
